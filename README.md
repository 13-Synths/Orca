## Programs

### `A` Add [passive]
This function expects 2 numerical values, adds them up to generate an index, and create the function corresponding to this index.

### `B` Bang 
The **bang** function is used to trigger various functions, only lasts one cycle.

### `C` Clone [bang]
Clones the westward function, eastwardly, on **bang**.

### `D` Down  
Moves southward.

### `E` Explode [bang]
Fires bangs in nearby available cells, on **bang**.

### `F` If [bang]
This function expects 2 functions, if the functions corresponds, F bangs southward. Erases function westward on **bang**..

### `G` Generator [bang]
Generates a `D` on **bang**.

### `H` Halt [passive]
Stops southward function from operating.

### `I` Increment [bang]
Increments southward numeric function on **bang**.

### `J` Jump [bang]
Moves the westward program to eastward, on **bang**.

### `K` Kill [bang]
Kills all nearby functions, on **bang**.

### `L` Left 
Moves westward.

### `M` Modulo 
Creates the result of the modulo operation of east and west values southward.

### `N` Turn [passive]
Creates a numerical function southward, based on the *runtime frame*.

### `O` Odd [passive]
Transforms into `Q` when a function is present northward.

### `P` Push [bang]
Is moved away, on **bang**.

### `Q` Even  [passive]
Transforms into `O`, and **bangs** southward, when a function is present northward.

### `R` Right [passive]
Moves eastward.

### `S` Shift [passive]
Converts neighbooring functions to directions.

### `T` Trigger [passive]
Bangs southward in the presence of `1`, `U`, `R`, `D` or `L` functions northward.

### `U` Up [passive]
Moves Northward.

### `V` Value [passive]
Creates a numerical value between 0 and 5 based on the number of present functions westward.

### `W` Warp [bang]
Warps northward function to the next available warp, and halts it, on **bang**.

### `X` Split [passive]
Bangs eastward on a westward `0`, and bangs southward on `1`.

### `Y` Automata [passive]
Game of life-like automation.

### `Z` Creep [passive]
Moves to a the next available location in a cycle of `U`,`D`,`L`,`R` based on the *runtime frame*.
