## Unstable Glyphs

- `B` is made obsolete with `F` that now bangs on equal.
- `K` is my obsolete by `x`, `g` or `p`.
- `V` should be made into two special glyphs, one for reading and one for writing.
- `Z` is basically useless, it might be useful to use it as a carrier when bound with a direction.
